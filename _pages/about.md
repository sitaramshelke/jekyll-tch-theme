Hello There!     
I am Sitaram, a graduate in Computer Engineering and I currently live in Pune, India.
I am passionate about learning new skills and coding. Some of my interests are backend development, golang and I wish to learn machine learning in the time ahead.


I am currently an intern at [Google Summer of Code](http://summerofcode.withgoogle.com) with [Performance Co-Pilot](http://pcp.io) organisation.    
You can find all of my projects on Github. :smiley:

Here is a link to my *[Resume](https://github.com/sitaramshelke/sitaramshelke.github.io/raw/master/assets/files/SitaramShelke.pdf)*.   
I like to make new friends, so ping me on twitter or you can mail me at sitaramshelke[at]gmail[dot]com .
