Today I learned some advanced things about GoLang also learned how Go is comfortable using libraries 
directly from GitHub. Tried to build a server which can give access to users after verifying credentials 
after querying from a database. I used postgresql for this. Advantage of using postgresql is that it is a relational
database but it has some unique features that allow us to store the data in the form of Key-Value pairs. For this we need
a special structure which known as HStore. little did we know of how to connect Go and Postgres we decided to do it in next meet. 
That's all folks.
