It was a very boring week studying for the In-Sem exams, finally it ended yesterday.Today is India's 69th 
Independace Day. With exams just finished we (Project GroupMates) met today to discuss and finalize the idea. Little did we
had any ideas, Anuj was prepared for this and he also brought two ideas. After discussing a lot we now know what exactly we are going to do. After that we discussed lot about things which were not relevant to project :sweat_smile:.That's all folks.
