Yesterday (01/09/2015) I interviewed at Vuclip Pune. Complete process had 4 rounds. One technical interview 
followed by a technical apptitude, a coding round and a HR interview. Technical round was not much difficult but 
the aptitude. It has multiple answers questions. There was a simple problem given for coding and HR was too intelligent.
Both the interviewers were highly experianced persons. It was a great experiance. That's all folks.
