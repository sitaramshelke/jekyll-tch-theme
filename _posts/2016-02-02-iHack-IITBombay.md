There's a good news for everyone, Team BeaconAgainstHumanity (Me with [Chinmay](http://chinmay1994.github.io/), [Rohit](http://indiantinker.github.io/) and [Anuj](http://anujdeshpande.com)) stood first runner up at iHack.
iHack is hackathon conducted at IIT Bombay and we participated in the category "Beacons in Retail". The main idea was to show how beacons can be used in retail to increase the sale and make user experience more convenient. It was conducted on 30-31st Jan.    
The details of our work are:

The [Mobstack](http://www.mobstac.com/) was one of the sponsor and they have a product named beaconstac which is beacon and it has very interesting SDK for android and ios. They have gives very  nice APIs for the developers and also the analytics part is already done by them and can be seen on their dashboard. Every team got one beacon for the hackathon and we had to build some working application showing the use of their APIs.     
We decided to create and android app for this.    
First thing we had to do was comeup with a cachy name for the app. Anuj and Rohit has got the right talent for this so it was done in no time.   
 
Name of the app :
## Retail Rancho    

After that we started listing out the possible features that we can implement in 36 hours and started to prioritize them. List of those features is:   
* Floor layout based navigation for user.    
  Basically plan was to show the the image of the floor plan of the retail shop which is simple to understand and mark the probable beacon positions on them. Since we had only one beacon we had to simulate the action of the user navigating with the beacon with the help of a tap on the mark of a specific beacon.     
* Live notification for the user.    
  Beaconstac has some interesting analytics of showing the users which are camped on a specific beacon, which mean that a user is waiting near a specific beacon from a long time. From this vendor can conclude that the user might be willing to buy the product but he/she is not buying it and if some discount offered he/she might buy it. So vendor could send a live notification to that specific user. For this we created an API for the vendor. 
* Smart Todo list
  This was one of the most innovative feature that we implemented. We often forget to buy a product that we actually went to a shop for. So we built a todo list which is checked when a person scans a product and it gives a notification to the used if the product is listed in the todo list. :)

That's all folks.
