This post is about [Gophercon India](http://www.gophercon.in/) 17. I was lucky enough to attend it. 

## Event
Event took place at [Hyatt Regency](https://www.google.co.in/maps/place/Hyatt+Regency+Pune/@18.5602638,73.9099539,17z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m12!1m6!3m5!1s0x3bc2c13f8898d47d:0xb720e75df7dab049!2sHyatt+Regency+Pune!8m2!3d18.5602638!4d73.9121426!3m4!1s0x3bc2c13f8898d47d:0xb720e75df7dab049!8m2!3d18.5602638!4d73.9121426) on 24–25th Feb. The venue had good  facilities and great food. It was closer from airport for speakers and attendees coming from out of Pune.

## People 
I met many people, all sharing same interests. Many of them had already been using Go at their workplaces, some were discovering opportunities to use it and a few, like me, playing with it for side projects. I had chance to learn new things from them, some of them had long working experience and it was great listening to them. A thing I noticed, most of the folks were from startups than the bigger organisations. It was interesting to note how they were using go at different places than I had imagined, like machine learning, load balancing etc. 

## Talks
Talks were the best part of the event. All talks were excellent with live code/examples. The speakers came from US, Japan, London and Italy covering almost all of the continents. 

### Day 1:
Opening keynote was given by **[Francesc](https://twitter.com/francesc)**, he talked about context in Go, how it should be used throughout our program and the best practices. **[Tiffany](https://twitter.com/tiffanyfayj)** talked about how to get started with Go. She presented a lot of helpful beginner resources, which in fact are much needed. **[William](https://twitter.com/goinggodotnet)** talked about “[Package oriented design](https://github.com/ardanlabs/gotraining/tree/master/topics/go#package-oriented-design)”, a beautiful approach to organise your project which totally makes sense. His talk was full of energy and there was a lot to learn. People were always seen around him in free time, trying to learn as much as they could. **[Takuya](https://twitter.com/tenntenn)** talked how can we use Go to build native Android and iOS apps. He [showed](https://www.slideshare.net/takuyaueda967/mobile-apps-by-pure-go-with-reverse-binding) the code and steps to do it. **[Vidyasagar](https://twitter.com/dumbyoda)** [talked](https://speakerdeck.com/doctorandabox/fast-and-scalable-machine-learning-with-golang) about how, he and his team used Go for machine learning. He talked about the tools and libraries that he used and showed the benchmarking of the performance he was able to achieve. **[Romin](https://twitter.com/iRomin)** [talked](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1rVrrJeFkP9IomBepl3Kzck4gtod9icHaP1xCMEPDRes/edit#slide=id.p) about how he had built a natural language conversation slack bot. He showed it live and it was amazing! I later talked to him and we discussed few other ideas around his demo. **Karthik** talked about how we can avoid Go routine leaks with simple tricks like keeping the count of goroutines. It was very informative. **[Kai](https://twitter.com/KaiWaehner)** [talked](https://www.slideshare.net/KaiWaehner/flogo-a-golangpowered-open-source-iot-integration-framework-gophercon) about project [flogo](http://www.flogo.io/) which is open source IoT framework, easy to setup and use without 0% coding. He showed its comparison with node red and AWS IoT. **[Manish](https://twitter.com/manishrjain)** talked about his project “[DGraph](https://speakerdeck.com/manishrjain/dgraph-graph-database-for-production-environment)”, which is a distributed graph database written fully in Go. He talked about its performance and internals. He also guided about when should we use graph database, dgraph comparison to Neo4J and Cayley. 

Many people presented lightening talks about their experiences with Go. All of them deserve appreciation.

### Day 2:
Day 2 started with a great talk by **[Aditya](https://twitter.com/chimeracoder)**, he [talked](https://speakerdeck.com/chimeracoder/cloning-git-in-go-gophercon-india-2017) about project ‘Gitgo’. It is git implemented in Go from scratch. He talked a lot about internals of git and how showed how git also stores diffs internally. **[Ian](https://twitter.com/IanMLewis)** [talked](https://speakerdeck.com/ianlewis/getting-plugged-in-with-go-1-dot-8-plugins-at-gophercon-india) about a newly added feature in Go 1.8- ‘Plugins’. With this, we can generate shared objects and use those objects at runtime as plugins. **[Aditya](https://twitter.com/aditya_sanghi1)** talked about implementation of a smart proxy, which allowed GoJek to separate transport services to newly written Go based server, from rest of the code, and how he could achieve upto 2000 sessions per second. **[Daniel](https://twitter.com/dwhitena)** talked about using Go for data science. He showed live examples with [gopherds](https://github.com/gopherds) libraries, and he was able to perform really good image recognition with berkley’s prebuilt model. **[Matthew](https://twitter.com/kanwisher)** [talked](https://speakerdeck.com/mattkanwisher/building-distributed-timeseries-database-in-go) about what is a time series database, uses, what options are out there and how he was able to build his own time series database named [vulcan](https://github.com/digitalocean/vulcan), by adding horizontal scalability to [prometheus](https://prometheus.io/). **[Filippo](https://twitter.com/FiloSottile)** [talked](https://speakerdeck.com/filosottile/you-latency-and-profiling-at-gophercon-india-2017) about how we decide something is fast, comparison between tracer and cpu profile and how tracer gives you more accurate latency information. **[Shiju](https://twitter.com/shijucv)** [explained](https://www.slideshare.net/shijucv/building-high-performance-apis-in-go-using-grpc-and-protocol-buffers), in a world where everyone is moving to microservices, the need of having fast data exchange between these microservices. He talked about the applications of gRPC which use protocol buffers for faster data transmission. **[Kamesh](https://twitter.com/EngineerKamesh)** talked about [Isomorphic Go](http://www.kamesh.com/outro/gci17_isomorphic_go.pdf) i.e. using Go at front as well as backend. He talked about GopherJS and showed code examples from simple statements like alert() to using a 3rd party 3D model rendering library.

I had great time for those 2 days and hope to attend next year too.

P.S. GopherconIn18 will be March next year in Pune :)

That's all folks.
